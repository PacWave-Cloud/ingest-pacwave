# Up-looking ADCP Ingestion Pipeline

This pipeline reads in binary files output from an ADCP mounted on a bottom lander. It 
is currently set up to read in water-track data from a 5 beam ADCP You may need to add 
or remove some variables if they aren't saved, as detailed below.

This README file contains instructions for running and testing this pipeline. Datafiles are saved under
"./storage/root/data" in netCDF4 and MATLAB file formats. Velocity, amplitude and correlation plots are 
saved in the corresponding "./storage/root/ancillary" folder.


## Prerequisites

* Ensure that your development environment has been set up according to
[the instructions](../../README.md#development-environment-setup).

> **Windows Users** - Make sure to run your `conda` commands from an Anaconda prompt OR from a WSL shell with miniconda
> installed. If using WSL, see [this tutorial on WSL](https://tsdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/wsl.html) for
> how to set up a WSL environment and attach VS Code to it.

* Make sure to activate the adcp-pipelines anaconda environment before running any 
commands:  `conda activate adcp-pipelines`


## Editing pipeline data fields
This pipeline is set up to handle data created by a Nortek Signature1000. It also has some basic parameters 
set up for sampling in Sequim Bay.

1. If you are not running the echo sounder, navigate to `pipelines/sigvm/config` and open `retriever.yaml`. 
Remove all entries that have the `_echo` tag. You can do this as well for `dataset.yaml`, but this isn't critical.

2. There are a number of parameters listed in `retriever.yaml` in lines 15-18 that should be updated.

    a. "depth_offset" is the distance below the waterline that the ADCP transducers sit

    b. "salinity" is the water salinity, which ranges around 31 for the channel into Sequim Bay

    c. "magnetic_declination" is the current magnetic declination. You can look this up online.

3. In `dataset.yaml`, update the information under the `attrs` block per the data collection specifics.

4. There is one parameter listed in `shared/quality.yaml` that can be updated:

    a. "correlation_threshold", on line 71, is for a QC test that removes velocity data below a certain % acoustic signal 
    correlation.

5. You may need to update the "trigger" listed in `config/pipeline.yaml` for your ADCP's binary file extension.


## Running your pipeline
This section shows you how to run the ingest pipeline created by the template.  Note that `{ingest-name}` refers
to the pipeline name you typed into the template prompt, and `{location}` refers to the location you typed into
the template prompt.

1. Make sure to be in the `acoustic_Doppler_pipelines` folder

```bash
cd $PATH_TO_PIPELINE/acoustic_doppler_pipelines
conda env create
conda activate adcp-pipelines
```

2. Run the runner.py with your test data input file as shown below:

```bash
python runner.py ingest $PATH_TO_DATA/{filename}.{ext}
```

3. Finally, data and plots are saved in `acoustic_Doppler_pipelines/storage/root/`
